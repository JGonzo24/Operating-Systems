CPE 453 - Program 2: Lightweight Process Library

DESCRIPTION:
This project implements a user-level lightweight process (thread) library with
cooperative multitasking. Threads are scheduled using round-robin scheduling
and can create, yield, exit, and wait for other threads.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Threads use mmap() for stack allocation (8MB default, aligned to page size)
- Context switching via swap_rfiles() assembly function
- Thread states managed via custom queues (blocked, zombie, global tracking)
- Round-robin scheduling rotates through ready queue
- Exit/wait coordination handles zombie threads and blocked waiters
- Main thread is NOT admitted to scheduler after lwp_start()

STATUS:
All core functionality tested and working:
- Thread creation with proper stack setup
- Context switching (yield)
- Thread termination (exit)
- Thread reaping (wait)
- Resource cleanup (munmap, free)
- Round-robin scheduling

EXECUTION:
- "make" for simple makes
- "make clean" for clean up
- "make snakes" for snake test
