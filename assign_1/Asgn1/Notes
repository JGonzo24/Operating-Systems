This is a simple subset of printf(3) that doesn't use malloc() in
order to simplify the development of your malloc library.  This doesn't
mean that you won't eventually want to support printf(3), but you won't
have to immediately.

SYNOPSIS

  #include <plnprint.h>

  void pp(FILE *where, char *fmt,...) {

DESCRIPTION

  Works mostly like printf(3) in a more limited way.  It currently supports
  the following conversions:

    %s
    %d
    %c
    %x
    %p

  with field widths and 'l' modifiers.

BUGS

  Doesn't work for most negative long.  Oh, well.

NOTE

  For best results, use this from the Given directory rather than making
  a copy.  This is definitely (at best?) beta software and may get updated
  should any errors be found.

  If you find any errors, tell me.
